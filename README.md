# Email-Spam-Classifier :
It involves categorize incoming emails into spam and non-spam. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to filter out spam mails based on their content and metadata.

# Description :
A spam filter is a program used to detect unsolicited, unwanted and virus-infected emails and prevent those messages from getting to a user's inbox. Like other types of filtering programs, a spam filter looks for specific criteria on which to base its judgments.

Internet service providers (ISPs), free online email services and businesses use email spam filtering tools to minimize the risk of distributing spam. For example, one of the simplest and earliest versions of spam filtering, like the one that was used by Microsoft's Hotmail, was set to watch out for particular words in the subject lines of messages. An email was excluded from the user's inbox whenever the filter recognized one of the specified words.

It is also a spam filter/email spam checker which designed by a machine learning algorithm and dectect which mail is ham and which one is spam.
